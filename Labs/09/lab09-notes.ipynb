    "- **_Dropout_**\n",
    "    -  a method where, during training, we randomly “drop” (ignore) a fraction of neurons in a layer\n",
    "    - Dropped neurons do not participate in forward pass or backpropagation for that training step\n",
    "    - Each training step uses a different random subset of neurons.\n",
    "    - During testing/inference, all neurons are used, but their outputs are scaled to match the effect of dropout.\n",
    "    - Purpose:\n",
    "        - Prevent the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons — encourages it to learn redundant, robust representations."
